// Create a variable that holds the RANDOM number between 1-20

var randomNumber = Math.ceil(Math.random()*20); 

// Part 1: Create variable that holds the number of turns

var turns = 5;

// Create a variable for your "hint to the user" Ex: Guess my number between 1-20

var user = "Guess The Number Between 1 - 20!";

// when is true != true?  What should our condition actually be?

while (turns > 0) {                       

prompt ("Not Quite! You Have" (Turns));
if (randomNumber != prompt )
turns--;

}

// Use the prompt method to ask the user for input. Use this to also display the "hint to the user"

var user = prompt ("Guess The Number Between 1 - 20!");

// Part 2: Also display how many tries the user has left

var guess = prompt('You have 4 Tries Left!');

// Convert the users guess to a number

// Use an if statement to see if the player's guess is equal to the random one generated

if (randomNumber == randomNumber) { 

    prompt ('You Guessed The Correct One!');

}

// Use an else statement to notify the user if they guessed incorrectly

else (num < num) {

    prompt ('You Guessed Too Low!')
    
    if (num > num)
        prompt ('You Guessed Too High!') 
    
}

// Part 2: Inside the else statement, tell the player whether their guess is too small or too big, Hint: you'll need to use an if statement



// Part 2: If the user runs out of guesses, tell them what the correct number is.  Hint: What variable did we use to define it?
